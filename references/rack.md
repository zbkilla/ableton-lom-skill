## RackDevice Class

This class represents a Live Rack Device. A RackDevice is a type of Device, inheriting all Device properties and methods.

**Inherited Children:**

| Property | Type | Access | Observable | Description |
|----------|------|--------|------------|-------------|

### Properties

| `can_show_chains` | bool | R | No | 1 = the Rack contains an instrument device that is capable of showing its chains in Session View |
| `has_drum_pads` | bool | R | Yes | 1 = the device is a Drum Rack with pads. A nested Drum Rack is a Drum Rack without pads. Only available for Drum Racks |
| `has_macro_mappings` | bool | R | Yes | 1 = any of a Rack's Macros are mapped to a parameter |
| `is_showing_chains` | bool | R/W | Yes | 1 = the Rack contains an instrument device that is showing its chains in Session View |

## Common Patterns

### Create and Configure a Rack
```python
def get_rack_info(rack):
    """Get comprehensive rack information."""
    info = {
        "name": rack.name,
        "class_name": rack.class_display_name,
        "is_drum_rack": rack.has_drum_pads,
        "chain_count": len(rack.chains),
        "return_chain_count": len(rack.return_chains),
        "macro_count": rack.visible_macro_count,
        "has_macro_mappings": rack.has_macro_mappings,
        "variation_count": rack.variation_count,
        "chains": []
    }

    for chain in rack.chains:
        chain_info = {
            "name": chain.name,
            "color": chain.color,
            "mute": chain.mute,
            "solo": chain.solo,
            "device_count": len(chain.devices),
            "devices": [d.name for d in chain.devices]
        }
        info["chains"].append(chain_info)

    return info
```

### Work with Drum Rack Pads
```python
def find_pad_by_note(drum_rack, note):
    """Find a drum pad by MIDI note number."""
    for pad in drum_rack.drum_pads:
        if pad.note == note:
            return pad
    return None

def get_occupied_pads(drum_rack):
    """Get all pads that have content."""
    return [pad for pad in drum_rack.drum_pads if pad.chains]

# Usage
kick_pad = find_pad_by_note(drum_rack, 36)  # C1
if kick_pad:
    kick_pad.solo = True
```

### Manage Macro Variations
```python
def save_and_recall_macros(rack):
    """Example of working with macro variations."""
    # Store current state
    rack.store_variation()
    print(f"Stored variation. Total: {rack.variation_count}")

    # Randomize macros
    rack.randomize_macros()

    # Store randomized state
    rack.store_variation()

    # Recall first variation
    rack.selected_variation_index = 0
    rack.recall_selected_variation()
```

### Navigate Nested Racks
```python
def find_all_devices_recursive(device, depth=0):
    """Recursively find all devices including those in racks."""
    devices = []

    devices.append({
        "depth": depth,
        "name": device.name,
        "class": device.class_display_name
    })

    if device.can_have_chains:
        for chain in device.chains:
            for nested_device in chain.devices:
                devices.extend(find_all_devices_recursive(nested_device, depth + 1))

    return devices

# Usage
for track in song.tracks:
    for device in track.devices:
        all_devices = find_all_devices_recursive(device)
        for d in all_devices:
            print(f"{'  ' * d['depth']}{d['name']} ({d['class']})")
```

### Copy Drum Pad with Sample
```python
def duplicate_drum_sound(rack, source_note, dest_note):
    """Copy a drum pad's content to another pad."""
    # Find source and destination indices
    source_idx = None
    dest_idx = None

    for i, pad in enumerate(rack.drum_pads):
        if pad.note == source_note:
            source_idx = i
        if pad.note == dest_note:
            dest_idx = i

    if source_idx is not None and dest_idx is not None:
        rack.copy_pad(source_idx, dest_idx)
        return True
    return False

# Usage
duplicate_drum_sound(drum_rack, 36, 48)  # Copy C1 to C2
```

### Work with Chain Selection
```python
def select_and_show_chain(rack, chain_index):
    """Select a chain and show its devices."""
    if chain_index < len(rack.chains):
        # Access view to see selection state
        view = rack.view

        # Check if chain devices are visible
        if view.is_showing_chain_devices:
            selected = view.selected_chain
            print(f"Currently selected: {selected.name}")

        # For Drum Racks, check selected pad
        if rack.has_drum_pads:
            pad = view.selected_drum_pad
            print(f"Selected pad: {pad.name}")
            print(f"Scroll position: {view.drum_pads_scroll_position}")
```

### Insert New Chain with Device (since 12.3)
```python
def add_chain_with_device(rack, device_name, chain_name="New Chain"):
    """Add a new chain to a rack with a device."""
    # Insert chain at end
    rack.insert_chain()

    # Get the newly created chain (last in list)
    new_chain = rack.chains[-1]
    new_chain.name = chain_name

    # Insert a device into the chain
    new_chain.insert_device(device_name)

    return new_chain

# Usage
new_chain = add_chain_with_device(rack, "Compressor", "Compressed Chain")
```
